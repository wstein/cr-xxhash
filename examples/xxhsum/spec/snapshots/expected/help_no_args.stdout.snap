xxhsum 0.8.3 (Using Crystal bindings)
Create or verify checksums using fast non-cryptographic algorithm xxHash

Usage: xxhsum [options] [FILES...]

When no filename provided or when '-' is provided, uses stdin as input.

Options:
    -H [ALGORITHM]                   select an xxhash algorithm (default: 1)
                                       0: XXH32
                                       1: XXH64
                                       2: XXH128 (also called XXH3_128bits)
                                       3: XXH3 (also called XXH3_64bits)
    -c, --check                      read xxHash checksum from [FILES] and check them
    --filelist                       generate hashes for files listed in [FILE]
    -h, --help                       display this help message

Advanced:
    -V, --version                    Display version information
    --tag                            Produce BSD-style checksum lines
    --little-endian                  Checksum values use little endian convention (default: big endian)
    --binary                         Read in binary mode (compat: no-op — files are binary by default)
    -b                               Run benchmark with default variant set (equivalent to -b1,3,5,11)
    -b [VARIANTS]                    Run specified benchmark variant(s)
                                     VARIANTS may be comma-separated IDs (e.g. "1,3,5") or ranges (e.g. "1-5")
    --bench-all                      Run all 28 benchmark variants (equivalent to -b0)
    -i [ITERATIONS]                  Number of times to run the benchmark (default: 3)
    -B [SIZE]                        Benchmark sample size (supports K,KB,M,MB,G,GB — 1024-based)
    -s SEED, --seed SEED             Seed (decimal or 0xHEX)
    --simd BACKEND                   Select SIMD backend for XXH3/XXH128 one-shot hashing (requires CPU support: scalar always works)
                                     Available: [SIMD_BACKENDS]
    -q, --quiet                      Don't display version header in benchmark mode
                                     Don't print OK for each successfully verified hash
    --amortized                      Use amortized streaming in benchmark mode (isolates hashing core from allocation)

The following five options are useful only when using lists in [files] to verify or generate checksums:
    --status                         Don't output anything, status code shows success
    --strict                         Exit non-zero for improperly formatted lines in [FILES]
    --warn                           Warn about improperly formatted lines in [FILES]
    --ignore-missing                 Don't fail or report status for missing files
