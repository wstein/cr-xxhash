**Summary**

Describe the problem and the steps to reproduce it.

**Checklist**
- [ ] I ran `crystal spec` and reproduced the failure locally
- [ ] If the issue relates to vendor test vectors, I ran `crystal scripts/generate_vectors.cr` and confirmed fixture parity

**Notes**
For vendor-vector / parity issues, see `papers/CONTRIBUTING.adoc` (section: "Regenerating vendor test vectors").
